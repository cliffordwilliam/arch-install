# 🐳 Docker Lifecycle on Arch Linux

A quick guide to install Docker, run a test container, clean up, and stop the service.

## ✅ Install docker from pacman

docker: container manager, cli interface

docker-compose: automates container setup with yaml reading ability

```bash
sudo pacman -S docker docker-compose
```

## ✅ Fix: Add your user to the `docker` group

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
## ✅ Reboot

```bash
reboot
```
  
## ✅ Docker Lifecycle You Just Performed

### 🟢 1. **Start Docker**

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### 🚀 2. **Run a container**

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

* Pulled the image because it wasn't local.
* Started and ran the container.
* Output confirmed Docker is working.
* You verified the container ran and exited:

  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```

### 🧹 3. **Clean up**

* Deleted the stopped container with:

  ```bash
  docker container prune
  ```
* Deleted the image:

  ```bash
  docker rmi hello-world
  ```
* Verified nothing left:

  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```

---

### 🔴 4. **Stop Docker fully**

```bash
sudo systemctl stop docker.socket docker.service
```

* This stops both the Docker daemon and the socket listener.
* No background triggers will restart it until you manually start it again.

---

sudo systemctl start docker
docker-compose up -d

#Stop and remove your Docker Compose containers
docker-compose down

#This stops Docker itself, so no Docker commands will work until you start it again.
sudo systemctl stop docker.service

#(Optional) Remove leftover containers/images if you want to clean all traces
docker container prune -f
docker image prune -a -f

#Or clean everything at once (warning: deletes all stopped containers, unused images, networks, and volumes)
docker system prune -a --volumes -f
